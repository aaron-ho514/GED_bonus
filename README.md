Singleton Pattern (Damage manager)
Not quite sure what a damage manager is even supposed to do for Wrecking Crew, so I am assuming it is supposed to keep track of how much damage the player done.
The singleton adds to the total damage done based on how much health the destructible object has, writes it to console debug, then destroys the object. The functionality 
for a hammer is not included, so it is based off of collision instead.




Feedback:

Assignments/tests should be made in a way that assesses our understanding of the course material. Many of us (the non-programmers) have very little experience with Unity
and will undoubtly have trouble creating a game from scratch in a 3 hour time window, especially without access to online tutorials or even Unity documentaion. I think
asking us to implement and explain the things we learned throughout the course is 100% fair, but having to also create a game can prove to be overwhelming. Yes, we have 
access to lab materials, but the labs are designed in a way where we copy whatever the TA codes, rather than understanding it.
An example of a well designed assignment is group assignment 1, where we had the opportunity to expand on our existing games, so we can focus on implementing and explaining
the design patterns and DLLs.
